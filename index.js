/*
As a web developer for a publishing firm, another problem has come up. Your boss would like you to create an algorithm that can determine the difference between non-vowel and vowel characters.

Write a function called characterCounter that takes in one parameter called bookText. You can expect that this parameter will always be a string representing some chunk of text from a novel. 

Your function should return an object that contains 2 key-value pairs. One with a key of "numOfVowels", which is a value that is a number representing the number of vowels. And another key-value pair with a key of "numOfNonVowels", which is a value that a number representing the number of non-vowels (including spaces and other punctuation). 

For example:

If your function was given the string of "Hello World!", your function would return the following object:

{
    numOfVowels: 3,
    numOfNonVowels: 9
}

Note that the number of non vowels incldues the spaces and punctuation mark characters.
